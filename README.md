Note prior to beginning of HTML project -

This is a project that combines all the skills that I have learnt in HTML up until this point. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Note post HTML project -

Nothing really learned here, except that <br> is an element that allows for a line break, a space between lines. I'm still not sure whether I'm commiting too frequently or if my commit titles are even good. But so far so good, no hitches.
